Domain Menu Permissions introduces a new permission Edit menu domain, which gives users that are assigned to a certain domain the permission to edit the menu (and only that) that is assigned to a domain as the domain's main links.

Domain Menu Permissions works similar as and borrows code from Menu Admin per Menu.

The functionality of Domain Menu Permissions should also be included with Domain Admin module, but that is not yet compatible with Domain Access 7.x-3.x.

This module is sponsored by Sinnoptics (www.sinnoptics.de).
